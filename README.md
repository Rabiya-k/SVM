Image classification is one of the classical image processing problems. There are various approaches such as Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree for solving this problem. Here Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify Images.

One of the main advantages of using SVMs for image classification is that they can effectively handle high-dimensional data, such as images. Additionally, SVMs are less prone to overfitting than other algorithms such as neural networks.

Image Classification with SVM

Objective: The primary goal of image classification with SVM is to teach a computer to recognize and categorize images into predefined classes based on their visual features.

Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of images, with each image labeled according to its class. images would be labeled as 'cat', 'dog', 'horse' or 'human'

2. Feature Extraction: Convert each image into a set of numerical features that capture its characteristics.

3. Data Preprocessing: Normalize and standardize the feature vectors to ensure they are on a common scale, which is essential for SVM's performance.

4. Training: Use the labeled images to train the SVM model. SVM aims to find the hyperplane that best separates different classes while maximizing the margin.

5. Testing and Evaluation: Evaluate the trained SVM model's performance by inputting new, unlabeled images. The model predicts the class of these images, and its accuracy is assessed based on the actual labels.
