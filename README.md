In order to classify an image using an SVM, we first need to extract features from the image. These features can be the color values of the pixels, edge detection, or even the textures present in the image. Once the features are extracted, we can use them as input for the SVM algorithm.

The SVM algorithm works by finding the hyperplane that separates the different classes in the feature space. The key idea behind SVMs is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, which is the distance between the closest points of the different classes. The points that are closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors.

One of the main advantages of using SVMs for image classification is that they can effectively handle high-dimensional data, such as images. Additionally, SVMs are less prone to overfitting than other algorithms such as neural networks.

In machine learning where the model is trained by input data and expected output data.
To create such a model, it is necessary to go through the following phases:

1.Import required libraries
2.Load the image and convert it to a dataframe.
3.separate input features and targets.
4.Split train and test value.
5.Build and train the model
6.Model evaluation.
7.Prediction
